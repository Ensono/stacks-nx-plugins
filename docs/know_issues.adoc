.*Unable to Serve Nextjs App*

*Description:*

You may see the following error when trying to serve a next application when using a custom server:

`throw new Error('Could not find ${fileToRun}. Make sure your build succeeded.');`

*Cause*

This occurs due to an issue in Nx version 16.4.0. This issue has been resolved in later versions of Nx.

*Workaround*

The workspace now uses Nx version 22.2.3 where this issue has been resolved. If you encounter this error with an older workspace, you can specify the Nx Version to use by using the --nxVersion argument, eg:

[source,shell]
--
npx @ensono-stacks/create-stacks-workspace@latest --nxVersion 22.2.3
--
