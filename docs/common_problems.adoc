== Common Problems

This document contains a list of common issues that may arise when using the stacks workspace and plugins. These are not bugs, and are usually a result of user error or configuration.

=== *Incorrect Nodejs version*

We recommend the latest LTS release of Nodejs. You can check what the latest version is here: https://nodejs.org/en

One error that has been seen as a result of being on an older Nodejs version is:

`.at is not a function`

If you encounter any errors that don't seem to have an obvious resolution it is always best to first check the version of Nodejs you're running.

=== *Trying to create a workspace in a folder under source control*

When creating a new stacks workspace, it needs to be created in a folder that isn't under source control by Git. If you try to create a workspace in a folder that is already a git repo you will see the following Nx warning during the creation process:

`Directory is already under version control. Skipping initialization of git.`

You will also likely see husky errors like the following:

[source,shell]
--
husky - .git can't be found (see https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=custom-directory)
npm ERR! code 1
npm ERR! path /repo/myworkspace
npm ERR! command failed
npm ERR! command sh -c husky install
--

To avoid this issue you need to make sure the folder where the stacks workspace is being created is not already a git repo.

=== *Existing node_modules in parent folder*

Having a `node_modules` folder in a parent folder of the stacks-nx-plugins project can sometimes cause issues, especially when trying to run the unit tests. You may sometimes get an error like the following:

`Cannot find module '@nx/next' from '../../../node_modules/@ensono-stacks/test/src/lib/create-next-app.js'`

This is just an example, and occurs when trying to run the unit tests for the next plugin. If you look in the folder path above you can see the `node_modules` folder is outside of the `@ensono-stacks` folder.

To fix the problem you need to delete the `node_modules` folder in the parent folder. You will be able to tell from the error which `node_modules` folder is being used. It must be the `node_modules` folder within the stacks project folder that is being used.
