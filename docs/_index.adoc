The Stacks NX-Plugins Infrastructure project contains all of the Terraform templates, build pipelines (for Independent Runner and Azure DevOps) to deploy the templates as well as tests to ensure that the infrastructure that is deployed is what is expected.

The tests are designed to be run on a regular basis; the Azure DevOps pipeline file for the tests is set to run at 0600 every morning. This is to allow developers and engineers to check that the resources are configured correctly.
