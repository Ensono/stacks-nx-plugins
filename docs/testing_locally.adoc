== How to Locally Test via Inspec

Ensure that your taskctl envfile OR environment variables contain the following values:

* `resource_group_name`
  - Description: Group containing all the resources for the Azure Kubernetes Cluster

* `location`
  - Description: Location that the resources are expected to be deployed into

* `container_group_name`
  - Description: Name of the container group

* `CHEF_LICENSE = "accept-silent"`
  - Description: Sets the Chef license acceptance to silent mode.

* `TESTS_PATH = "/app/deploy/tests"`
  - Description: Specifies the path where the tests are located.

* `REPORT_FILENAME = "inspec_azure_aci.xml"`
  - Description: Defines the filename for the InSpec Azure ACI report.

=== How to Run

* Via your own envfile (*_envfile can be anything you wish to call it upon creation but must be in your root directory!_*):
```
taskctl tests envfile
```

* Via your environment variables, loaded into your current terminal session:
```
taskctl tests
```

=== Things to check

* Your tests are located in the `~/deploy/tests/controls` directory and your `inspec.yml` has the correct inputs, for example:
```yaml
# Define the inputs for the control
inputs:
  - name: resource_group_name
    description: Group containing all the resources for the Azure Kubernertes Cluster
  - name: location
    description: location that the resources are expected to be deployed into
  - name: container_group_name
    description: Name of the container group
```
* Your infrastructure has been deployed, as Inspec is testing against LIVE Infrastructure via Inspec Train & the Azure REST API - Read more here: https://github.com/inspec/inspec-azure!
