== Introduction

The Azure Container Instance Project is about building upon the original Stacks philosophy of deployment of applications into Kubernetes Clusters, but providing an alternative method/infrastructure choice for people who want to manage and support their application stack without the prior knowledge Azure Kubernetes Service requires.

Currently this project is very basic, but with future iterations, this will be an alternative selection within the Stacks-CLI project!
